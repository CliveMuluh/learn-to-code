            <p>programming is the act of giving an instruction for the computer to carry out. On the other flip, a scripting language is used to write 
                and display text. So HTML 5 is more of a scripting language than it is a programming language </p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Should I get a Computer Science <span class="text-muted">degree?</span></h2>
            <p class="lead">
              Alot of people drop out of college because they heard someone saying that getting a degree is completely 
              which may be true. But I want I want you to understand that we each have a unique path to follow with regards 
              to learning to code. Some can teach themselves how to code while other need more time and may have other personal 
              issues to deal with. I also want you to understand that what it may take one person 20 days to understand, it may take 
              another person 20 hours to understand. So if you are currently in college, go for your degree. While being in college,
              you can be using your free time to take an online course on another programming language.
              Being in college gives you eneough time to plan out your path and work on how oeefective you can be in what you do.
              <br>
              Leanring some skills on entrepreneurship will be a great step towards your career in tech. So that you will not just end up
              writing code but you will code with the aim of serving the community.

            <p class="lead">
            I may not be the most experienced person to tell you this but there are two basic steps to mastering the 
            fundamentals of a new language.
            <ul>
              <li><h5>Master the fundamentals</h5>
              <p>The best way to being a new programming language is by mastering the fundamentals very well. Bacic conceptes like 
                arrays, functions and objects are tools you do not want to leave out. Knowing why they function the way the do is of 
                paramount importance.
              </p></li>
              <li><h5>Practice , Practice and Practice</h5>
                <p> Programming is not some kind of literature. If reading makes you understand concepts better, fine snd good but learn to practice as 
                  much as you can. The more you practice, the more you make mistakes and the more you make mistakes the more you learn and the more you learn the more 
                  you become a pro at it.

            <p class="lead">If you master the fundamentals of one programming language, you are atleast 5% gone into another language.
                The only thing which may differ are the syntax, but the logic behind it remains the same. Python has very easy syntax unlike c++  but 
                this doesn't mean c++ is too abstract. One thing is sure, the concepts of a langage gets harder as you proceed. For this reason I would advice you to spend
                a good amount of time mastering their fundamentals

                yourself. Some concepts will be very easy to understand but some may actually take days and weeks but all you need is too stay motivated,
                know who you are and strive for your goals.

            <p class="lead"> JavaScript is a very important programming languge. I can't over emphasize on the importance 
              of javascript but I want you to understand that javascript is a beginner friendly language which can be used for 
              both web and mobile applications. In addition to this, it is fast growing and has alot of community support by 
              big tech companies like google. However, studying just javascript is not a enough, adding a framework to it will go a 
              long way in helping you...Check out <a href="https://codewithmosh.com/p/angular-master-class" target="_blank">angular</a> or <a href="https://codewithmosh.com/p/mastering-react" target="_blank">react</a> for more information.
